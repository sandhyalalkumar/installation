VM model was far better than physical model. But in the current software world, 
the world of microservices using VM is costly affair. Containers are light weight
VM which secure and efficent.

After installing an operating system on a machine, its becomes single user space.
In the method of containerization, a software convert the single user namespace into
mutiple isolated and independent namespaces/user spaces.
